#Coupling gene names: a script to change count tables with ENSEMBL identifiers to one with gene names
#This script does not require any R packages, only the mart_export.txt file

#Set the working directory to the one that contains mart_export.txt
setwd ("/scratch/szande_jarts")

#Import the list of gene names from mart_export.txt
names <- read.delim("mart_export.txt", header = TRUE, sep = "\t")

#Set the working directory to the one that contains the count table
setwd("/scratch/szande_jarts/data")

#Import your count table. Change the name of the file to the name your file has.
#Keep in mind that my data is in a TSV format, but CSV is also supported if you change sep="\t" to sep=",".
data <- read.csv("GRCh38.p13-counts_PKC.tsv", header = TRUE, sep= "\t")

#Change the column names for easier merging. Change the second and third column name to what you want to call your samples.
#Do not change the name of column 1, "Gene.stable.ID".
colnames(data) <- c("Gene.stable.ID", "PKC_1", "PKC_2")

#Couple the gene names to their ENSEMBL ID
coupled_list <- merge(names , data)

#Remove the ENSEMBL IDs so that only the gene name remains
coupled_list_trimmed <- subset(coupled_list, select = -c(1))

#Export the new counts table to your working directory
write.csv(coupled_list_trimmed, "coupled_list_trimmedKC_primary.csv")
